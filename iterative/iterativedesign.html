          <h1 class="sectiontitle">Project Overview</h1>
          <h5>
             Our aim for this project was to design a user interface for an emerging startup's concept, 
             using an iterative design process flow - sketching ideas, creating an interactive hi-fi prototype that 
             incorporates critiques, conducting user testing, and contacting the startup. Working in a group of 4, 
             we designed an interactive desktop interface for WANTD, a platform for buying and selling trendy sneakers.

          <h1 class="sectiontitle">1. Selecting a Startup</h1>
          <h5>
            We chose WANTD, an online sneaker marketplace specifically for sneaker resale. It aims to facilitate fast, efficient resale for resellers and buyers. Its concept includes:
            <ul>
              <li>Virtual storefronts</li>
              <li>Bulk inventory management for resellers, using bulk listing tools</li>
              <li>Live video auctions</li>
           </ul>
            We also saw it as a hub for lovers of sneaker culture. The concept interested us - we wanted to see how we could make it feel like a sneaker site as opposed to any e-commerce fashion site.

          <h5>For Home, we decided to keep it simple - lots of images, minimal text. We included a Trending section for sneaker fanatics and Top Sellers to make things fun. In our menu, we have a news tab help people keep up with sneaker styles and trends.</h5>

          <h2 class="section-name">Browse</h2>
          <h5>We kept the shopping page visual and clean, with immediately visible filtering options for easier searching. Hearts can be used to 'save' or 'follow' an item.</h5>
          <img style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%;" src="lofi/Browse.png" />
          <h5>For viewing specific items, we chose a modal popup instead of redirecting to a new page, so the user can switch in and out easily.</h5>

          <h5>The cart is simple, focusing on important details. We included relevant navigation options (Continue Shopping, Wishlist, Checkout).</h5>
          <img style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%;" src="lofi/Cart.png" />

          <h2 class="section-name">Profile</h2>
          <h5>We designed the profile page to summarize a user's selling 'stats'. The side menu helps navigate to different profile sections. Having rankings gamifies the site a little, adding some fun.</h5>
          <img style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%;" src="lofi/Profile.png" />

          <h2 class="section-name">Listings</h2>
          <h5>Including Current Listings and Unlisted allows users to upload items they might want to sell without having to list them immediately (the collection of Unlisted items).
            The checkboxes under each item enable bulk listing - the seller can check the items they want and use the buttons to manage all at once (i.e., list many items in one click).</h5>

            <li>Browse for the desired sneaker.</li>

          <h5>Note that this is not an actual website, but rather a mock/prototype of one. This means that while the interface will resemble a webpage, not all the components are clickable. However, following the instructions, you should be able to navigate through the website by clicking on the relevant buttons!</h5>

            <li>Log into the website. Assume that your username and password are already filled out.</li>
            <li>Once logged in, browse for the "Jordan 1 Retro High: Dior" shoe.</li>
